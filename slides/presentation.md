# What is it?

Math Island is an open source game designed for 4th graders to learn fractions

+ Provides many levels of challenge
+ MIT licensed
+ Started from scratch
+ Mixed open source and home grown art
+ Easy level editor

---

# How is it played?

+ Robot wonders the island looking for a way home
+ Fuel is used to move

# Worst Pieces of software

---

# Stumbling blocks

- Different parts of the system were developed in parallel, so sometimes there was a failure to communicate design ideas

---

# Successes

- Having a level editor makes it easier for the community to contribute new levels

---

# Doing things differently

- Would have been better to meet up more frequently/make sure that all members were up to date on the status of all of the components

---

# In the future

- Level validation
	- There's no guarantee that levels are actually solvable at the moment
- Random level selection
	- Students would get bored playing the exact same levels in the exact same order every time
- General polish
	- Cleaner UI
	- Better explanations about things like tiles
- Better integration between components
	- levels.py declares some utilities that MathIsland.py could find useful

+ Art needs polishing
+ Replace existing open source art with home grown
